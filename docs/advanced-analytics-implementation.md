const correlations = await analyticsService.analyzeHabitCorrelations(userId, {
  minCorrelation: 0.7,
  minConfidence: 0.8,
  includePositive: true,
});

// Use insights to optimize routine
correlations.forEach((correlation) => {
  if (correlation.strength === 'strong') {
    console.log(
      `Schedule ${correlation.habitName1} and ${correlation.habitName2} together`
    );
  }
});
```

### Generating Predictions

```typescript
// Get 30-day predictions for all habits
const predictions = await analyticsService.generateHabitPredictions(userId, {
  timeframeDays: 30,
  minConfidence: 0.7,
});

// Focus on habits needing attention
const atRiskHabits = predictions.predictions.filter(
  (p) => p.predictedValue < 0.6
);
```

### Creating Custom Dashboard

```typescript
const dashboard = await analyticsService.createCustomDashboard(userId, {
  name: 'Fitness Focus',
  description: 'Track my fitness and health habits',
  widgets: [
    {
      type: 'line_chart',
      title: 'Exercise Progress',
      dataSource: 'habit_completion',
      timeRange: 'month',
    },
  ],
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No correlations found**: Ensure sufficient habit data (10+ days)
2. **Low prediction confidence**: Check data consistency and completeness
3. **Export failures**: Verify file size limits and storage availability
4. **Performance issues**: Check database indexing and query optimization

### Debug Information

- Enable debug logging for correlation calculations
- Monitor prediction accuracy over time
- Track export job performance metrics
- Analyze database query performance
