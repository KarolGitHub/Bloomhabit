## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Users sign up or log in with OAuth.
2. Each habit is visualized as a unique flower in their personal garden.
3. Completing a habit waters the flower, helping it grow and bloom.
4. Missing a habit causes it to slowly wilt ‚Äî encouraging gentle accountability.
5. The AI Gardener analyzes streaks and patterns, sending personalized nudges.
6. Users can keep journals that "enrich the soil" for future growth.
7. Notifications remind users to maintain their habits.
8. Responsive design ensures the garden looks beautiful on all devices.
